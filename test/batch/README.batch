batch.ats contains 4 source lines.

filter test (filter_test.ats) - It selects one out of 3 test scripts that 
matches np=1, and then submit the test script to batch system.

stickdefs test (stickdefs_test.ats) - It is a batch submission test with
stickdefs('batch=1') to see if iftest_2tests.py is submitted to batch system.

ifTest.ats - It contains 2 lines. stick_iftest.py contains stick(batch=1'),
so it is to be submitted to batch system.
interactivetest.py contains "if cond: test(...,batch=1)" and expect to be
submitted to batch system.

There is source('batchtest/simpletest.py') to see if it is either skipped or
submitted to batch depending on ats option of "-b bank_acct".


1) if you do a "ats batch.ats", 4 tests are skipped, and 3 tests are filtered.
   4 skipped tests has "batch=1" set, so it is as it should.

2) if you do a "ats -b axcode batch.ats", then it runs under batch, and
   4 skipped tests above should be submitted to the batch system.
